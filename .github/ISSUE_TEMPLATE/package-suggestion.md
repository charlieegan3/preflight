Package suggestions are ideas for new Preflight packages or package rules. Please use this template for:

- Recording configuration erros or any other problems that our customers may experience
- Recording best practices or features that would help us avoid the above

**Package Name**

For example GKE, AKS, Istio, RBAC, Pods, etc.
This could be an existing package or a package that doesn't exist yet.
If this suggestion is just one rule, please specify the package it should belong to.

**Package Rule(s)**

The rule or rules you are suggesting.
Ideally, your suggestions should include as much detail as possible with links for more information.

Please label this issue with `package` and `package/[PACKAGE_NAME]`.
For example `package/gke`.
If no label exists for this suggestion's package name please create one.

Please consider any associated risks, assumptions, and dependencies.
